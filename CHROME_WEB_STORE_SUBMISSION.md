## üîí Privacy Practices Tab

### **Single Purpose Description**
```
This extension identifies the nationality and ethnicity of names by analyzing their linguistic and cultural characteristics using AI technology.
```

### **Permission Justifications**

#### **activeTab Permission**
**Justification:**
```
The activeTab permission is required to allow users to select text (names) on any webpage. When a user highlights a name, our extension displays a popup button to analyze that name. This permission ensures the extension can read the selected text and inject the analysis interface into the current page without requiring broad access to all website data.
```

#### **Host Permissions (all_urls)**
**Justification:**
```
The <all_urls> host permission is necessary because users need to analyze names on any website they visit. This permission allows our content script to run on all pages, enabling the text selection feature and popup display functionality. The extension only reads user-selected text and does not access or collect any other webpage data.
```

#### **storage Permission**
**Justification:**
```
The storage permission is used to securely store the user's OpenAI API key locally in the browser. This key is necessary for the name analysis functionality. The key is stored using Chrome's sync storage API, allowing users to maintain their settings across devices. No other data is collected or stored. Users have full control to delete or update their API key at any time through the extension interface.
```

#### **Remote Code Use**
**Justification:**
```
This extension does NOT use remote code. All code is bundled within the extension package. We only make API calls to OpenAI's API service to analyze names, which is necessary for the core functionality. No remote JavaScript code is loaded or executed.
```

**OR if they ask specifically:**
```
Not applicable - This extension does not use remote code. All functionality is contained within the packaged extension files.
```
